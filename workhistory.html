    <h2>My story</h2>

    <p class="lead">
            As well as working in the field, I am also studying towards a bachelor's degree at Haaga-Helia university.
            I started my career in IT during vocational school at the electronics store chain Gigantti. I was tasked with running a helpdesk for customers buying a PC. I also helped with selling various electronics such as phones, monitors and televisions. 
            I gained a lot of meaningful experience in customer service during my time at Gigantti. My interest in computers also rose from this experience.<br>
            After Gigantti I worked at Ilmarinen, CGI and the government of Finland. Most of these jobs were similar in that they were all customer service and ICT specialist type of helpdesk jobs. 
            I have gotten a lot of local support experience and people skills are as honed as my IT skills. <br>
